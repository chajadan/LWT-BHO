LWT BHO

Browser Helper Object for Learning With Texts, Internet Explorer Extension

LWT BHO allows LWT users to continue the same type of learning they do with static plain texts and extends it to cover browsing arbitrary webpages. The hope is to encourage users to engage in the learning process more often, as the average person is already browsing regularly, but may not always visit their LWT site.

I was inspired by the openness of the author of LWT, who simply published something for free and open source that he wrote for his own studying. In that same vain, I make all code for LWT BHO open source as well.
